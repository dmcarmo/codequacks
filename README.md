## Seriously...

This crazy project started as an idea for the Airbnb clone challenge in [Le Wagon Web Development bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/lisbon/web-development-course/full-time#curriculum). The goal of that challenge was to build a Rails app for a rental business (hence the Airbnb clone) using [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates) (created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team) to jumpstart the Rails app.

The [initial project](https://github.com/dc-lewagon/Airdnd) was developed by these coding wizards:
* [David Carmo](https://github.com/dmcarmo)
* [David Wylie](https://github.com/7thwave42)
* [Isaline W](https://github.com/isaline-w)
* [Sylvia Grill](https://github.com/SilviaG8)

After the bootcamp both David's decided to fix the remaining bugs while adding some missing functionality, and so Codequacks was born.
    
### How it was built?
This project uses Ruby on Rails (plus a plethora of gems), Bootstrap and some Javascript magic.
