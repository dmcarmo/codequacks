## Seriously...

This crazy project started as an idea for the Airbnb clone week challenge in [Le Wagon Web Development bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/lisbon/web-development-course/full-time#curriculum). The goal of that challenge was to build a Rails app for a rental business (hence the Airbnb clone) using [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates) (created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team).

The [initial project](https://github.com/dc-lewagon/Airdnd) was developed by these coding wizards:
* David Carmo
* David Wylie
* Isaline
* Sylvia Grill

After the bootcamp both David's decided to fix the remaining bugs while adding some missing functionality, and so Codequacks was born.
